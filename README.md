Currently PhD student in Quant Marketing at University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I was working as an Empirical Research Fellow at Kellogg School of Management in Quantitative Marketing. 

Before starting this position, I graduated from 
London School of Economics with MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (2022-23) and 
BSc (Hons) + MSc Economics from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.


Fun fact: I am a big reader and read over 50 fictional books every year (and some
non-fiction too!)

I am looking for opportunities to up my skill set.
